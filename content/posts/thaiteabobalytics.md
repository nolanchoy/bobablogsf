Welcome to the “What Is The Price” Series where I will be exploring the right price for bubble tea and boba drinks around San Francisco. All of this can be explored in the <a href="../../thai_tea_bobalytics">Bobalytics Dashboard</a>. Find out which stores sell Thai Teas and for how much!

I know your frustration! I too have stared blankly, for countless hours at the vague and unhelpful $ and $$ categories on Yelp. What is “$”? What is “cheap” for boba? What is “expensive”? If you haven’t browsed Yelp for boba prices recently, to catch you up to speed, you will NEVER see a boba store labelled $$$, with all shops falling under either $ or $$. As you can imagine, binary classifications like these offer little flexibility to say what is ridiculously expensive and what is a penny-pinching steal. Has this indecisive nomenclature been the perfect cover to allow rogue tea shops to raise prices unchecked? Doubtfully… Regardless, let us burn away one more shelter for these runaway prices. Let us expose them. Let us cast holy judgement on $10 bobas and uplift $4 saints in these trying times.

As a part of this series, I’ll be setting my own clearly-defined price guidance, breaking open that untouched “$$$” and even "$$$$" real estate.

This week I’ll be taking a look at Thai Iced Tea specifically, where I <a href="/posts/dragoneats">once</a> made the bold assertion that you would be hard pressed to find one cheaper than the $4 DragonEats Thai Tea. 

Below is an analysis on Thai Tea drinks from 63 vendors around the Bay Area with hand-validated prices.

### Bad Data or Active Deception

As it turns out, almost all yelp menu prices are either outdated or wrong. Prices had to be manually corrected by up to a full dollar at times. Likely is the case that restaurants have failed to update prices on the Yelp menu platform. There has even been more than one instance where a shop that had previously listed prices on their menus, even those physical menus at their locations, no longer have prices available. One might conclude that inflation has forced these prices to such unsavory levels that they would prefer to hide their menu prices from the public only to spring it upon us at the cash register. Indeed at least one of these shops is in the $$$ range.

The standard process of validating prices was either aligning with prices via online ordering prices or via menu images taken after Summer 2022 (since inflation was in full swing by then). Due to the inaccuracies in Yelp menu prices, this is a less automate-able analysis than I would have hoped for this series.

## My Thai Tea Pricing Guide

<b>Median Thai Tea Price:</b> $5.25

<b>$ </b>~ < $5

<b>$$ </b>~ $5 - $5.75

<b>$$$ </b>~ $5.75 - $6.5

<b>$$$$ </b>~ > $6.5

### Breakdown

How do I define these pricing classes? Good question.

Quantiles can be thought of as dividing all your prices into 4 buckets each with equal 1/4 proportion of the total population. 

$ is made up of everything below Q1 (quantile 1). A drink in the bottom 1/4th of all prices will be considered $. 

$$ is made up of everything between Q1 and Q3. 50% of all datapoints will live here and this will be considered the standard price. Not necessarily a bargain and not necessarily overpaying. This is a good value for your drink.

$$$ is made up of everything between Q3 and Q4. The top 1/4th of all prices will be considered $$$. This is where you might think twice about how much you are paying as this is more than your average drink.

$$$$ is made up of everything above Q4, technically outliers. This is where a shop had better be coming up with something novel, something unique that pushes the maximum of what boba can be. This is likely not your average Thai Tea and if it is, then this is a sign to run for the hills.

You might be wondering, "Well what about outliers on the lower end?", or prices below Q1. This is unlikely to ever be the case due to prices having a minimum price cap, with considerations to the cost of materials and business margins, pricing will be right skewed with a long upper tail. If there does exist by some miracle an outlier below Q1, we will consider this in the not-yet-existent “basically free” category.

## Best Thai Tea in SF?

Prices alone cannot indicate how good a thai tea is. Certainly you will have overpriced teas that are of lesser quality and cheap teas of great quality. But comparing Yelp ratings with the price of Thai Tea might give us a clue into where we might find the "best" Thai Tea. I had also mentioned in my <a href="/posts/dragoneats">DragonEats post</a> that a drop in price might also coincide with a drop in quality. This hypothesis appears to be borne by the data as well.

We can see there is a clear pattern. Higher Yelp ratings are strongly correlated with higher prices. Perhaps it is to be expected that paying for higher priced drinks also pays for higher quality, making the paradoxical cheap and high quality teas an even more noteworthy exception to the trend. 

Of course, one caveat is that ratings are for the whole store, ambiance, service, and others drinks included. Those factors still play a role in creating the "best" drink, but ratings are not a direct measure of Thai Teas.

To answer my initial question, DragonEats does in fact have the cheapest Thai Tea in town to my knowledge and finds itself on that sweet margin of high ratings (4 stars) and cheap prices ($).

TiBear claims the title of highest priced drink on this list with a whopping $$$$ $8.75 specialty drink called Thai Tea Tornado. The store describes it as a "Classic thai milk tea with puff cream and black sugar boba. Top[ped] with thai tea ice cream." A full dessert treat may be worthy of that $8.75 price sticker.

Chome comes in second for highest priced drink with its Thai Iced Tea. From its description as "Freshly Brewed Thai Tea, half and half, and whipped cream", it sounds like a fairly average Thai Tea with an astronomical price. The cost of getting a beverage at a fancy restaurant? No clue.

The two 5 star reviews included here are both in the "$" range. These are Tea Plus Tea Bar who's high Yelp rating I might chop up to it's low review count of 8– or maybe it truly is that great. The other is Sweet Glory, with 114 reviews. Something special must be brewing there to land it a high review count, a perfect rating, and a "$" Thai Tea. This has certainly been added to my list of places to try in the near future.
