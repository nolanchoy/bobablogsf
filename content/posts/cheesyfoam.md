Oh cheesy foam<br>
We’d only met this last month<br>
But in this short time I find that our love shines brighter than any before<br>
At first sight I was mildly perplexed<br>
“What kind of disgusting, sick freak adds cheese to their tea?”<br><br>
But you opened my eyes<br>
Opened my heart<br>
Showed me the way out of my cave<br>
Out of my arid mono-flavored drink desert<br>
The salty complimenting the sweet<br>
The gentle creamy melding with refreshing bliss<br>
A wild rollercoaster of flavors with every sip<br>
The yin and the yang<br>
The eb and the flow<br>
The topping to top them all<br>
Enter the bubble tea third dimension<br><br>
Oh cheesy foam where have you been all my life 🧀🍦<br>
