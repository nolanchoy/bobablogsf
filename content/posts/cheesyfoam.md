Oh cheesy foam
We’d only met this last month
But in this short time I find that our love shines brighter than any before
At first sight I was mildly perplexed
“What kind of disgusting, sick freak adds cheese to their tea?”
But you opened my eyes
Opened my heart
Showed me the way out of my cave
Out of my arid mono-flavored drink desert
The salty complimenting the sweet
The gentle creamy melding with refreshing bliss
A wild rollercoaster of flavors with every sip
The yin and the yang
The eb and the flow
The topping to top them all
Enter the bubble tea third dimension
Oh cheesy foam where have you been all my life
