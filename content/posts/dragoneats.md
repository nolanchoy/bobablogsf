Let me get this straight... Your first review on a "boba blog" is of a drink that doesn't have boba... from store that doesn't sell boba? Sacriligious! Deception! 

Let the scandals and the gossip fly, for they hold no bearing over me. I will speak this truth: from price to taste, DragonEats' Thai Iced Tea fires on all cylinders and is an audacious rebuttal to all the bloated priced boba drinks around the Bay Area.

### Multiverse of Cheapness
If there are infinite universes and infinite possibilities, then DragonEats' Thai Iced Tea exists in an alternate timeline where Covid-19 never happened and price inflation is but a myth. By some divine intervention, the $4 price tag seen from 2018 menu pictures has remained consistent through to 2022 (knock on wood). Around San Francisco, <a href="/posts/thaiteabobalytics">the standard price</a> for a good thai iced tea is $5. Any less and one might expect lesser quality or taste. Yet DragonEats proves that $5 is not the price floor for good tea in the Bay.  Maybe more an indication of the price levels in San Francisco, but I would be hard-pressed to find any other boba/tea drink at this price-point for this quality.

### Diamond In The Rough
Let's get the rough out of the way. Spend 5 minutes with a paper straw, and your joy will turn as soggy as the straw. There is no beating around the bush. I do not enjoy sipping out of a limp noodle. Nobody does. In any universe or any timeline.

Onto the diamond. Thai iced tea has a distinct flavorâ€“ one I may fawn over often in this blog. There are a few central elements, simple yet essential, that makes a good thai iced tea _good_. The color should be that of a deep and vibrant orange of a burnt clay (though that signature color comes from food coloring and not the actual tea). The flavor must be bold and confident, offering tones of an earthy cinnamon and mellow vanilla. Like an old opera singer, a thai iced tea should sing different notes, at different pitches, with a rich story to tell behind each. DragonEats has every one of these for a perfectly sweet, deep, and balanced tea symphony.

Something must be said about the visuals as well. The tea is served in a clear ready-made cup. Beginning with a strong shade of dark brown, the staff adds in half-and-half which cascades down, between ice cubes, blending into the dark tea abyss. With a quick swirl it becomes that gorgeous a iconic thai orange color.

DragonEats serves their tea with half-and-half. I admit, in my view, condensed milk provides a complementary note to the drink that makes it all the more rich. That being said, this thai tea does not feel lacking in any element for having used half-and-half.

Overall a wonderfully strong thai iced tea with an otherworldly price for San Francisco.

Price: $

Taste: 9/10
