description: "Ambitious drinks, bold flavors, and an exotic menu in the heart of Hayes Valley, though occasionally missing the mark on the bare basics"
---

Vibrant color combos, plastic clouds, layers and swirls— all eyes are on your drink as you walk down Hayes Street just coming from the relatively new Zero&. The whimsical-looking fruit cocktails, only found at Zero&, are sure to draw you in. But, when it all does come together, the powerful flavors and the freshness of the fruit will make you stay. When it does come together seems to be up to the time and day. I’ve had some truly fantastic drinks and some others that miss the mark. Even so, Zero&’s attractive location and menagerie of exotic, eye-catching, and bold flavored drinks has me coming back for more, despite the sometimes hit-or-miss quality.

### Heart of Hayes Valley
The new tea shop made its debut in the otherwise largely un-boba-tapped neighborhood of Hayes Valley last December 2021. Likely due to high rents of the popular hip-and-happening location, Zero& is one of the only bubble tea stores in the neighborhood, but has strategically situated itself directly at the heart of Hayes Valley. Nested between fashion stores and restaurants, with the allure of the zany drinks coming out the door and the brightly lit beacon of a store itself, its no surprise that it’s still a popular attraction even a year after its opening. Depending on the time of day, sizable crowds will fill up the small store. Yet this hasn’t stopped great turn around times  for each drink order ~under 5 minutes. 

Other nearby stores include Urban Ritual a couple of blocks away, and Boba Guys somewhat farther away, near Market St. Nothing gets closer to the center of Hayes Valley than this though.

### Over-Brewed Icarus
How does the myth go again? Icarus, the legendary Greek brewmaster, tried so hard to make the most radical, juicy cocktails that he fell flat on his basics? No no. That’s not it. Icarus, warned of hubris, flew too close to the sun and drowned in the sea. Tragic.

Zero& is by no means drowning, but could still stand to learn from the old greek myths and cautions. Its well-designed combos of fruit juices, slushes, creams, and teas makes for tough choices at the cash register. But Zero& has mixed performance when it comes to whether those drinks live up to their decadent ingredient list, menu monikers, and price tag. When done well, their drinks are near unrivaled in the Bay. This strength is in their flavors. Bold and brash. All of their drinks, good and sub-par alike, pack distinct flavors that highlight each drink’s profile. This is especially true with the fruit based drinks where the use of real fruits brings the out the best (juiciest) parts of the real deal.

The Passion Lemonade has a distinguished passion fruit flavor, bringing the fruit’s tangy and tropical elements to tango with a tart lemonade. The Lychee Blossom packages the flowery, creamy, and peach-like juiciness of lychee into a refreshing beverage. This is where the brand’s self-described use of “premium ingredients” shines through. Each of these drinks boasts its fruit count: Lychee Blossom - 20+ Lychees, Coco Mango - 2 Whole Mangoes, Strawberry Mango - Half Pound of Fresh Strawberry… It’s evident from the taste of these drinks that using real fruit, rather than simple syrups, pays off in dividends. This is home field for Zero&, each fruit drink knocking it out of the park.

But Icarus flew too high, unaware of the sea falling away from below him, melted his wings, and collapsed into the waves. Unfortunate to say, but Zero& comes up as passable when it comes to those drinks that require more technical elements. Zero& has no issue nailing the measurement game of fruit smoothie blends. But teas and bobas, cooking processes that require more deftness of hand and finesse, are the primary shortcomings for this store. 

The Teapuccino I ordered, presumably a mix of black tea and coffee (though it does not note any coffee in the description), was extremely bitter. No doubt bitterness is expected for a coffee and tea combo. But unlike the coffee/tea combos I’ve had elsewhere, where coffee adds a complementary, deeper, richer note to the tea, this bitterness was a brute-force overpowering of any delicate intricacies that might be found in their harmony. I would attribute this to overstepped tea or over-extracted coffee. The boba I had along with the Teapuccino, rather than an expected chewiness and tenderness, was overly soft and gummy– undeniably overcooked boba. I’ll chalk these up to my arrival an hour-ish to closing (by no means close to closing still, but later in the day) where this boba was likely drawn from the last batch made, and the tea/coffee pulled from the last brew. Still, for prices in the mid-tier to upper range, this is no excuse for sub-par drinks.

Hayes Blue - Coconut milk, Coconut Juice, and Pea Flower Tea. There’s nothing inherently wrong with this drink. It’s just a very cute, small, overpriced, but refreshing coconut juice and coconut milk with a plastic cloud. The pea flower tea has no impact on the flavor of this drink— placing it on the margin of gimmicky and tourist-trappy for its investment in unique visuals more than its unique taste.

## Conclusion
Not all drinks are created equal at Zero&, and it goes to show that the bare basics are often more challenging to master than even the higher end beverages. But where it does excel, in its collection of creative fruit drinks, it shines brighter than what most other boba shops in the city can do. Drinks like “Two Grapeful”, “Strawberry Marble” and “Baby Peach” are on my list of To Try’s. The bold flavors and exotic menu design will have me coming back like a Pokemon trainer trying to catch ‘em all. The Bay Area bobaverse is chock full of boba shops already, many doing the same thing. But even in the occasional instances where it falls flat, I commend Zero& for its creativity in its drink designs, in the audacity of its flavors, and for confidently carving out its own unique voice in this city. Hayes Valley is a great place to come to grab food and do some light shopping (window shopping if you have a budget like mine), and when I find myself in the area next time, I know that Zero& will be a must stop shop.
