It’s mango madness! From mango slushies targeting the lower end of the price spectrum to the new craze of mango pomelo sago drinks targeting crazy rich asians, this week were taking a look at mango dessert drinks (non-tea mango drinks) for the second entry to my series, “What is the Price?” This is the series where I painstakingly collect hundreds of menu prices to create a clearly defined price guide for SF boba drinks. Check out the mango drink deep dive in the <a href="../../mango_bobalytics">Bobalytics</a> dashboard.

In the <a href="../thaiteabobalytics">last edition</a> of “What is the Price?”, I covered Thai teas, which lie at a lower price point due to its simplistic nature of being tea and milk. This week we’re looking at something on the higher end of the price scale that appears to be popping up around the Bay more frequently. Mango slushies, lattes, smoothies, and sagos are more akin to portable desserts than they are to the milk teas on menu, topping off the higher price points for those looking for an infrequent treat (or frequent depending on your wallet size). 

Mango sagos in particular, and other mango-coconut milk drinks, are a derivation of the popular Hong Kong mango pomelo sago dessert puddings. These creamy desserts are made using palm starch pearls called sago, coconut milk, mango, and pomelo, a less bitter twin of the grapefruit. But, mangos and milk is certainly no flavor combination owed entirely to the Hong Kong-based dessert. Mango Lassis, though not included on this list (maybe in the future), are proof that creamy mango drinks are universally loved! What better companion to an already creamy fruit than more cream! But enough talking about drink backgrounds like I’m some well travelled Food Network host. Getting down to brass tacks, how much does liquid mango really cost?

Below is an analysis on mango drinks from 60 vendors around the Bay Area with hand-validated prices. 

## My Mango Drink Pricing Guide

<img alt="Prices" src="/img/mango/prices.png"

**Median Mango Drink Price:** $6.25

**$** ~ < $5.5

**$$** ~ $5.5 - $7

**$$$** ~ > $7

### Breakdown

How do I define these pricing classes? Good question.

Quantiles can be thought of as dividing all your prices into 4 buckets each with equal 1/4 proportion of the total population.

$ is made up of everything below Q1 (quantile 1). A drink in the bottom 1/4th of all prices will be considered $.

$$ is made up of everything between Q1 and Q3. 50% of all datapoints will live here and this will be considered the standard price. Not necessarily a bargain and not necessarily overpaying. This is a good value for your drink.

$$$ is made up of everything between Q3 and Q4. The top 1/4th of all prices will be considered $$$. This is where you might think twice about how much you are paying as this is more than your average drink.

### Subclasses

Not all mango drinks are created equal. Within this umbrella class of mango drinks, I have defined 3 subclasses of Slushes, Latte/Smoothies, and Sagos. Specific price guidance for these drinks can be found in the “Subclass Price Summary” tab of the <a href="../../mango_bobalytics">Bobalytics</a> dashboard. But to summarize:

**Median Mango <u>Slush</u> Price:** $5.5

**Median Mango <u>Sago</u> Price:** $7.25

**Median Mango <u>Latte/Smoothie</u> Price:** $6.5

Sagos being the most direct translation of dessert to drink, these are the highest priced subclass of the mango beverage taxon. Then on the opposite end, the milk-less slushes are the lowest priced of the subclasses.

### Price Soft Cap?

Dare I say we have found evidence of the drink price cap? Does no shop want to price anything above $9, even for dessert drinks? I think there might be some implicit understanding that nobody in their right mind would pay more than $9 for a drink. 9 rubs shoulders with 10 and being that close to double digits likely makes people squeamish, so here we are with $8.95 drinks capping out the highest prices for both mango sagos and latte/smoothies.

But who are these $9 (let’s not pretend $8.95 isn’t basically $9) culprits? Time for a Scooby Doo unmasking. Well, well. If it isn’t Tea Plus’ Mango Sago and Zero&’s Coco Mango. I should have known! Zero& is a newer bubble tea shop located in Hayes Valley that opened last December (12/2021). Being located in the heart of Hayes Valley and offering drinks of the self-described "highest quality”, with nearly all drinks on their menu being unique specialty drinks, if any shop were to have a $9 drink, Zero& would make the most sense. Given all these factors, that $$$ price might make sense to some. I have yet to make a visit, but I’ve heard some of the hype. In due time we’ll see if the new kid on the block has really got the chops to earn that price tag.

Coming in second highest in the price book is Little Sweet’s $8.5 Mango Sago. This is one drink that sparked my interest in making mango drinks the second entry to the price guide series. I’ve been to the Inner Sunset location on several occasions and wondered to myself if the price of a mango sago drink was really this much elsewhere around the Bay. Surprise! It’s even expensive compared to other sago drinks. Granted, it’s a very good drink for a walk through Golden Gate Park and has elevated many a summer days, so I have no qualms about the value I’ve gotten out of it. But in the future, I might think twice before smothering my face in an $8.5 mango drink.

Mangos and milk is a dangerously delicious combo! So come time to treat yourself to a once-in-a-while dessert drink or even a mid-day treat, by all means, don’t hold back. All I hope is that this guide puts prices in perspective for yours and my own curiosity.
