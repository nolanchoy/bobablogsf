### A Blank Canvas

The sun rises upon a new day, this early morning of October 25th, and with it a new website. What is this site? Nothing yet– but soon to become a scrappy home to the muses and ruminations of good boba, bad boba, and everything in between. For now, my audience is myself only, and to that end this blog is to capture my present thoughts, feelings, and judgements, to be a creative outlet for pretentious writing, and a place to stay up to date about the latest boba news (to avoid discovering a great new tea shop a whole year after its opening).

My ultimate aim is for a well crafted record of my tea-laced escapades around the Bay so that in my retirement of this site (should there ever be one), there should hold a pristine history of my travels for all future generations of boba lovers to come–a Library of Alexandria of boba of sorts. And to those future audiences who may drift in and out of this site, I promise you no objective journalism, but only the raw passion that I have for this drink and my unfettered, unabashed, and unpurchased opinions. Big Boba and their cronies will never silence me!

The plan for this blog is 1 post per week, for a total of 52 posts per year. 52 boba shops to visit? I pray for my wallet. I don’t even think I want boba that much.

### Charted Waters

There is a boba map currently accessible in the main menu (top-right) that links to an interactive map. This is where you can find information about recent shop openings and shop locations around the bay. The main municipal focus will be San Francisco as that is within the purview of the opening date database I have joined with Yelp data. 

Underlying data for this map will be updated monthly, along with marking reviewed locations on the map. The Yelp API may tag shops unrelated to boba so if there are any markers that should not belong, feel free to send a message to blog@bobablogsf.com with any notes. Additionally, if there is any shop that is missing feel free to also send a message my way.
