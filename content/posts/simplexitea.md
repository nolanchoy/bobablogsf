Make no mistake, I highly recommend the tea from this shop. SimplexiTea offers a small selection high quality tea and boba leaving little to be desired except a second serving. The tea has a strong flavor, indicative of a quality roast, and a fresh brew. The boba is tender, chewy, plump and sweet; just right. The Hong Kong style milk tea also has a strong tea flavor, and a unique profile distinct from the classic black milk tea with its signature condensed/evaporated milk.

On tea and flavor alone this shop is hitting high marks.

My only gripe with the actual drink is that it is twice as sweet as it should be. I ordered the store-recommended 50% sweetness for two drinks and found them a tad too sweet. Not on the levels of sweetness like Milk Tea Lab (not yet reviewed) or iTea (not yet reviewed) but still sweeter than what I was expecting for 50%. I like my drinks sweet but not overly so, therefore 25% would be my recommendation. I shudder to imagine what diabetic monstrosity 100% sweetness would be.

## The Dilemma

This store has me wondering, though, if taste alone should be _**the**_ determining factor for a nomination as a top boba shop. Certainly on the merits of its tea, SimplexiTea has earned its place on that list. That I will not deny. But the store lacks charm, vibrance, and life. The location is dreary and uneventful. The atmosphere is unremarkable at the least. Despite a small selection of simple yet banger drinks, I struggle to come up with any other element that would make this a “destination” boba shop. Not that location “pizzazz” is any requirement to be considered a good boba shop, but my objective when making a bubble tea recommendation is to recommend a place that people should want to check out, that is worth stopping by for. SimplexiTea is a boba shop I would only recommend if you happen to be in the area.

### Atmosphere

I described the atmosphere as unremarkable at the least. At the worst it is uninviting. The only decoration I recall is the neon sign hanging from the otherwise plain grey wall, announcing the store’s name. The sign exists more so as if it were meeting some requirement of having at least one object on the walls than it exists for any desire to add personality. The kiosk replaces any need for human interaction. If lucky, you might be able to catch a glimpse of the lone worker hustling to make your drink from behind the high countertop. After ordering from the iPad touch screen, I went to sit at the bar stools lining the outer wall while my drink was prepared. Even the steel bar stools are uncomfortable to sit on. I chose to move outside to wait. I would be surprised if this store *wasn’t* trying to win a design award for the most physically uncomfortable and uninviting store. If Boba Guys lacks a bit of soul, SimplexiTea has the soul of a printer; An industrial tea printer with a bubble tea print job.

A store's energy should be an extension of the drink– a message from the store owner saying, "Come try my tea" or "Look what we have to offer! Welcome". Here at SimplexiTea, the message is radio silence, existing as if it were some corporate investment just to get boots on the ground in the new bubble tea trend. 

Perhaps it is catering to the Twitter employees across the street who need a quick in and out and don’t plan to stay. Perhaps it’s for the NEMA residents who live in the apartment complex above and would rather bring their drinks to their rooms. Perhaps it’s confined by its small physical space that limits what it can do. Whatever the case may be, SimplexiTea has clearly put zero effort into creating a welcoming or inspiring space, making me want to visit as much as I want to visit a printer— only when I need a print job.

### Location

Unlike many shops around the bay nested in interesting neighborhoods to walk through, SimplexiTea has all the charms of the Van Ness & Market St intersection and of Civic Center… that is to say none at all. It’s too far from Hayes Valley to make it relevant to that neighborhood when there are already good shops closer by. With a stale atmosphere, the only audience this shop could attract would be those visiting Civic Center, tech and twitter employees (perhaps a comfort drink to your layoff), or nearby residents of the new apartment complexes.

## Conclusion

Is good tea enough to make a boba shop a recommendation? SimplexiTea makes a strong case that tea alone is not the entire package. At the start of writing this review, I was writing a fully-backed endorsement for SimplexiTea, but as I continued to recount my experience, I have mixed feelings. It’s difficult to review a store whose tea I would wholeheartedly recommend, but whose store’s design language is so without care or heart that I can’t help but reconsider that recommendation. The tea is great, if not one of the best. If you are ordering delivery, a hands down recommendation. But for visiting, when the store meets only the bare minimum of being “a place that boba comes out of”, I can only recommend it if you happen to be in the area.
