description: "A deceptively simple formula to be a top contender for the best bubble tea in San Francisco"
---

Where is the best bubble tea in San Francisco? This is one of the central questions that this blog will attempt to answer. My first nomination to this high title may be a contentious one. This is no local gem in need of an endorsement, no hole in the wall small fry trying to make it big. No, none of those. But here on this blog, the only qualifications are two, 1. the shop is in San Francisco, and 2. they sell boba. Today I will lay out arguments for and against Boba Guys.

Boba Guys finds itself this blog’s first nomination to “best boba in San Francisco” by its deceptively simple but consistently sharp arsenal of drinks, making it no surprise it has built itself a stronghold in the Bay Area’s bobaverse and beyond.

### Franchise, Franchise, Franchise

Boba Guys is maybe first and foremost a good franchise before it is a good boba shop, evidenced by the fact you will find their shops all the way out in New York, and by the fact that it is one of the largest bubble tea chains in San Francisco (6 stores in SF according to the <a href="../../map">boba map</a>). If any characteristic were to define its strengths as a franchise, it would all come back to something I would describe as “deceptively inoffensive”. A characteristic fundamental to its strengths but that also beleaguers it.

There exists a “vibes” spectrum in which all San Francisco bubble tea shops fit. On one end you have bubbly, colorful shops with 100 menu items mixing and matching your heart’s content of yogurt drinks, fruit teas, milk teas, puddings, and jellies, Taiwanese paraphernalia decorating the walls, and Chinese translations below menu items. On the other end you have Boba Guys, an all white and black store, with 8 standard menu items and 10 specialty drinks. Boba Guys embodies that sleek, clean look of a 3rd wave coffee shop, boiling down all the pop and culture of bubble tea to its bare bones. Inoffensive. It takes after the Shake Shack formula, offering a simple standard menu of high quality core offerings. What it does, it does well, with the same level of consistency and quality across all locations.

It’s that same unoffending look, though, that lacks a bit of soul — the one that panders to everyone and no one at the same time, oozing a shade of the sterile tech-bro culture (or lack thereof) sweeping major cities. Tis’ a struggle at the heart of any growing city and perhaps a topic for another time.

### Quality above all

Simplicity allows the quality of the ingredients to take the spotlight. This is the unifying theme across all of Boba Guys’s drinks. Each drink, sans toppings, can be broken down into 3 ingredients at most– no extravagant concoctions here. The simplicity of the drinks allows each ingredients' flavor to take center stage.

The Classic Black milk tea tastes like good black milk tea. When you put together a strong black tea, Strauss milk, and simple syrup, there is simply no room for error. The tea has a signature slight roast flavor and a rich milk that makes the tea oh so smooth and silky. Nothing earth-shattering, but “tea with milk” is really the extent of what I expect out of “milk tea”.

Boba at boba guys has consistently had of some of the best quality boba pearls I’ve had in the Bay Area. Thickness, chewiness, tenderness, and with a hint of honey; every little aspect counts in distinguishing great boba from good boba. Boba Guys maxes out in all categories. This is where good tea, good milk, and great boba, becomes larger than the sum of its parts. No one part can shine to its potential should any other component be lacking. Boba Guys nails all.

The crown jewel for this chain is the strawberry matcha latte. Bright and earthy matcha layered atop quality milk layered atop house-made strawberry puree, this triple-tiered drink proves yet again that simplicity and quality ingredients reign supreme. I, myself, have taken to avoid mixing the drink to appreciate each flavor separately. A sip of matcha, of milk, or of strawberry and boba, or a blend, it matters not– this drink is an absolute must-try for anyone in need for a refreshing beverage to accompany them on their day.

Other drinks on the menu (Hong Kong Style, Thai Iced Tea, and Black Sesame Latte) are a calibre lower. Though certainly not bad drinks in their own right, and I doubt have bad quality ingredients, they are a step down in the same depth of flavor and power of the ingredients that the prior two mentions have.

### Price
$5.70 for a Classic Black with boba. I define Boba Guys as the standard at which I can attain good boba and tea at a reasonable price. Therefore, Boba Guys is well priced for San Francisco.

### Conclusion

The holy grail can provide everlasting life. But choose the wrong chalice and your life may very well end (<a href="https://youtu.be/LRSjKfvm368?t=10">me drinking bad boba</a>). More often than not, I am not looking for life or death boba. With the price of boba reaching $6 or $7, a bad drink, rather than complementing a beautiful day, can set it sour. So come time to pick a chalice, should I know a certain cup will always hold nothing but plain water, but damn good water at that, I'll have no shame in picking that glass and guzzling it down every time.

Perhaps it's that no-frills look that has you lay down your guard. A deceptively plain-looking drink to set your expectations low… when out of left field comes that bang upon first sip. For its lack of colorful gimmicks, earning repute based on taste and quality alone, it has my respect.

Boba Guys makes good boba look trivial. But after having had bad boba after bad boba across the country, clearly it is not so. So when I go out and I have a craving for boba, I need look no further than Boba Guys for a good cup. Boba Guys sets the bar high for the bare basics.
