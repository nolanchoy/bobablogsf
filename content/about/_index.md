My name is Nolan. Welcome to my blog!

Imagine a young 22 year old Batman, veins pumping with hot vigilante blood. Instead of heir to a billion dollar fortune, a day job as a data analyst. And by night, rather than serving up knuckle sandwiches to the city's criminal underworld, an even deeper, darker, more repressed burden he carries- boba enthusiast. What you have imagined is not Gotham's Batman but San Francisco's very own Bobaman. That man is me. This is my story.
